% This is a main matlab program for simulation of a quarter-car model.

%%%%%%  Define global variables  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

global ms mu ks kt % vehicle parameters 
global height duration % road profile parameters
global cpass % damper parameters

%%%%%%  Set initial data  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% data for a bump road (global)

tf = 3; % final time for integration
N = 500; % number of time points
tspan = [0:N]*tf/N;
