% This is a main matlab program for simulation of a quarter-car model.

%%%%%%  Define global variables  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

global ms mu ks kt % vehicle parameters 
global height duration % road profile parameters
global cpass % damper parameters

%%%%%%  Set initial data  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% quarter-car model (global)
ms = 337;
mu = 55;
ks = 22750;
kt = 245000;

% data for a bump road (global)
height = 0.1; % [m]
duration = 0.5; % [sec]

% damper model (global)
cpass = 2000;

% data for numerical integration
t0 = 0; % initial time for integration
tf = 3; % final time for integration
N = 500; % number of time points
tspan = [0:N]*tf/N;

%%%%%%  Simulation of passive damper system  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
