% This function solves IVP(Initial Value Problem) by fixed step
% Runge Kutta method of 4th order.
% IVP: dx/dt = f(t,x) , x(0) = x0
%
% dfun must be of the form: dx = dfun(t,x) or [dx,y] = dfun(t,x)
% where y is an output vector.
% dx and y must be column vectors.
% When dfun returns y, compute y only when global variable I_EVAL_Y = 1.
%
% In Runge Kutta of 4th order, f(t,x) is computed 4 times in one step. 
% This function sends out the order number that f(t,x) is computed using
% global variable N_EVAL_F. By using this variable, the user can
% implement zero order hold of controls.

%   tf: final time 
%   x0: initial condition of x (must be a column vector)
