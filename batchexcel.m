% Description of input Excel file
%
%  - only one cell contains the word "rpm"
%  - rpm vector (row vector) is located right next to "rpm"-cell
%  - length of rpm vector is not known
%  - there is no data to the right of rpm vector
%
%  - only one cell contains the word "throttle"
%  - throttle vector (row vector) is located right next to "throttle"-cell
%  - length of throttle vector is not known
%  - there is no data to the right of throttle vector
%
%  - only one cell contains the word "torque"
%  - 1st element of torque matrix is located next to and below of "torque"-cell
%  - dimension of torque matrix is (# throttle)x(# rpm)
