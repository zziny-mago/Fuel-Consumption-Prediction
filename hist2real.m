function [X,Y,Z,xx,yy,zz,Xaug,Yaug,Zaug] = hist2real(x,y,nx,ny)

% This function plots 2D histogram for a data set of (x, y).
% (You can try hist2integer when x and y are integers)
%
% Input
%   x : input vector (length of x must be equal to length of y)
%   y : input vector (see above)
%   nx: number of bins for x
%       if nx = 3, 3 intervals are as follows:
%                 xmin   <=   1st interval  <=   (xmax-xmin)/3
%       (xmax-xmin)/3    <    2nd interval  <=   (xmax-xmin)*2/3
%       (xmax-xmin)*2/3  <    3rd interval  <=   xmax
%   ny: number of bins for y (see description of nx)
%
% Output
%   X : 1-by-nx vector containing first values of x intervals
%   Y : 1-by-ny vector containing first values of y intervals
%   Z : ny-by-nx matrix containing occurrence counts
%       Z(i,j) is number of occurrence of X(j)-interval and Y(i)-interval
%       The reason why Z is not made nx-by-ny is for using surf function.
%   xx, yy: column vectors that contain only (X,Y) elements that occurred
%           at least once
%   zz: column vector of the same length as xx and yy containing
%       numbers of occurrence of (xx,yy)
%   Xaug : 3*nx-by-1 vector containing augmented version of X
%   Yaug : 3*ny-by-1 vector containing augmented version of Y
%   Zaug : 3*ny-by-3*nx matrix containing augmented version of Z
