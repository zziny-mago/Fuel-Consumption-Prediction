function [xe,ye] = find_edge(xa,ya)

% [xe,ye] = find_edge(xa,ya)
% This function finds the edge points so that they include all the points
% inside the polygon formed by them. To find the edge points, angle is used.
%
% Input
%  xa: x vector
%  ya: y vector (xa and ya must have the same length)
%
% Output
%  xe: x vector for the edge points
%  ye: y vector for the edge points
%
%  Note that (xe,ye) are in ccw order starting from the rightmost point. When there
%  are more than one rightmost point, the one with the smallest y is chosen.
